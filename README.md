Now that you have Vim installed on your system, let's dive into the basic commands and shortcuts that will help you get started.

## Getting Started with Vim

To open a file in Vim, use the following command:

```shell
vim <filename>
```

For example, to open a file named "example.txt," you would use the command:

```shell
vim example.txt
```

Once you have a file open in Vim, you'll be in normal mode, where you can navigate, edit, and execute commands.

## Navigating and Editing

### Moving within the Document

- `h` moves the cursor one character to the left.
- `j` moves the cursor one line down.
- `k` moves the cursor one line up.
- `l` moves the cursor one character to the right.
- `w` moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
- `b` moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.
- `0` (zero) moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
- `$` moves the cursor to the end of the current line.
- `gg` moves the cursor to the first line of the document.
- `G` moves the cursor to the last line of the document.
- `<line-number>G` moves the cursor to a specific line number.

### Copying, Cutting, and Pasting

- `v` enters visual mode, allowing you to select text.
- `y` copies the selected text (yank).
- `d` cuts the selected text (delete).
- `p` pastes the copied or cut text after the cursor.
- `P` pastes the copied or cut text before the cursor.

### Undoing Changes and Quitting

- `u` undoes the last change.
- `Ctrl + r` redoes the last undone change.
- `:q` quits Vim (closes the current file).
- `:q!` quits Vim without saving changes.
- `:w` saves the changes to the current file.
- `:wq` saves the changes and quits Vim.

### Searching and Replacing

- `/` enters search mode.
- Type the search term and press Enter to search forward
- `?` enters backward search mode.
- Type the search term and press Enter to search backward.
- `n` jumps to the next occurrence of the search term.
- `N` jumps to the previous occurrence of the search term.
- `:s/search-term/replacement` replaces the first occurrence of "search-term" with "replacement" in the current line.
- `:s/search-term/replacement/g` replaces all occurrences of "search-term" with "replacement" in the current line.
- `:%s/search-term/replacement/g` replaces all occurrences of "search-term" with "replacement" in the entire file.

## Buffers and Windows

Vim allows you to work with multiple files simultaneously using buffers and windows.

### Buffers

- `:e <filename>` opens a file in a new buffer.
- `:ls` lists all open buffers.
- `:b <buffer-number>` switches to a specific buffer.
- `:bd` closes the current buffer.
- `:q` quits Vim if no other buffers are open.

### Windows

- `:sp <filename>` splits the current window horizontally and opens the file in the new window.
- `:vsp <filename>` splits the current window vertically and opens the file in the new window.
- `Ctrl + w + w` switches between open windows.
- `Ctrl + w + h/j/k/l` moves the cursor to the window in the corresponding direction.
- `Ctrl + w + c` closes the current window.

## Advanced Features

### Macros

Macros allow you to record a sequence of commands and replay them.

- `q<register>` starts recording a macro in the specified register (e.g., `qa` starts recording in register `a`).
- Perform the desired commands.
- `q` stops recording the macro.
- `@<register>` replays the macro stored in the specified register (e.g., `@a` replays the macro stored in register `a`).

### Marks

Marks allow you to quickly navigate to specific locations within a file.

- `m<letter>` sets a mark at the current cursor position (e.g., `ma` sets a mark named `a`).
- `'` followed by the mark letter jumps to the line where the mark is set (e.g., `'a` jumps to the line of mark `a`).
- ```` followed by the mark letter jumps to the exact cursor position where the mark is set (e.g., ````a` jumps to the cursor position of mark `a`).

### Plugins

Vim supports a vast ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. Here are a few popular plugins:

- [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim): A plugin manager for Vim.
- [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree): A file explorer plugin for Vim.
- [CtrlP](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim): A fuzzy file finder plugin for Vim.
- [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe): A code completion plugin for Vim.

These plugins can be installed and managed using plugin managers such as Vundle or Vim-Plug.
